        It has long been thought that teen instant messages contained
        abbreviations (such as <i>LOL</i> for "laughing out loud" and
        <i>MAIBARP</i> for "my acne is becoming a real problem"), short forms
        (such as <i>L8R</i> for "later" and <i>R2D2</i> for "R2D2"), and slang
        (such as <i>whassup</i> for "what's up" and <i>yo</i> for "Hello, I am
        pleased to meet your acquaintance. Do you wish to have a
        conversation?"). However, the report reveals that this so-called
        "teenspeak" began to change so fast that kids simply could not keep up.
        Each teen developed his own lingo, and the instant messaging system
        developed into anarchy.x
