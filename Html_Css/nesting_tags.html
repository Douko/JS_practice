      Dear reader: Do you see the red button in the upper-right corner of this
      page?
      <strong>Never, I repeat <em>never</em>, click the red button!</strong> You
      have been warned.

        Here's what the great jurist Oliver Wndell Holmes, Sr. had to say about
        puns:
        <blockquote>
            A pun does not commonly justify a blow in return.
            But if a blow were given for such cause, and death
            ensued, the jury would be judges  both of the facts
            and of the pun, and might, if the latter were of an
            agravated character, return a veredict of justifiable
            homicide.
        </blockquote>
        Clearly, the dude was not a pun fan.

    <p>Whether you love or hate people who pun, you can't argue 
        with Ron Wolfe, who said that <q>A punster is someone who 
        sticks by his word.</q>
    </p>
    <p>
        The WHATWG says that using the q element is optional and 
        that 
        <q cite="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#the-q-element">
        using explicit quotation punctuation without q elements is 
        just as correct.
        </q>
