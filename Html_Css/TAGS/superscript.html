      Everyone, from the factory worker to the faculty member, appreciates some
      aspect of language; everyone is, in one way or another, "bethump'd with
      words"<sup>1</sup>.
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p><sup>1</sup>This phrase comes from Shakespeare:</p>

    <blockquote>
      Zounds! I was never so bethump'd with words<br />
      Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.<br />
      -<i>King John</i>, 1596, Act ii, Scene 2
