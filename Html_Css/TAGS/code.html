      Way back in 1994, someone at Netscape (one of the original web browsers)
      had the not-so-bright idea that text that blinked on and off would be a
      good thing. Thus the <code>&lt;blink&gt;</code>
      tag - the most reviled tag of all time - was born.

      Plugging in that URL produced the dreaded
      <samp>404 Not Found</samp> error.
