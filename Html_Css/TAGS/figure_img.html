      Checking out the source code of a web page ins't normally a "fun"
      experience. Most often, your goal is to get the name of a file or to
      figure out how the site performed some HTML or CSS magic. But every once
      in a very long while you can find a surprise, even a delightful one,
      waiting in the source code. As shown in Figure 1, I came across one such
      surprise the other day while viewing source on a page from
      <i>The Guardian</i>
