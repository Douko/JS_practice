      The HTML specs published by the WHAT Working Group are notoriously dry,
      fussy, and judge-sober. However, every now and then some wag sneaks in a
      bit of humor:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      A person's name is not the title of work - even if people call that person
      a piece of work - and the element must therefore not be used to mark up
      people's names.
    </blockquote>
